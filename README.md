# expo-background-streamer üöÄ

A powerful background file uploader for Expo/React Native applications, inspired by both [android-upload-service](https://github.com/gotev/android-upload-service) and [VydiaRNFileUploader](https://github.com/Vydia/react-native-background-upload). This module provides robust background upload capabilities with progress tracking and encryption support.

- üöÄ Streaming uploads (no temporary files needed)

## Installation

```bash
npx expo install expo-background-streamer
```

## Usage

```typescript
import ExpoBackgroundStreamer from "expo-background-streamer";

// Start an upload
const uploadId = await ExpoBackgroundStreamer.startUpload({
  url: "https://your-upload-endpoint.com/upload",
  path: "/path/to/your/file.mp4",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
    Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
  },
  // Optional encryption
  encryptionKey: "your-base64-encoded-key",
  encryptionNonce: "your-base64-encoded-nonce",
});

// Listen for upload progress
const subscription = ExpoBackgroundStreamer.addListener(
  "upload-progress",
  (event) => {
    console.log(`Upload progress: ${event.progress}%`);
  }
);

// Cancel an upload
await ExpoBackgroundStreamer.cancelUpload(uploadId);

// Clean up listener
